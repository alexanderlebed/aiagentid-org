# Terminology

This document defines the minimal terminology used by the aiagentid.org proposal.

The purpose is not to introduce new concepts,
but to stabilize language around already emerging phenomena.

---

## Artificial Agent

An artificial agent is a semi-autonomous entity that:
- acts on behalf of a human or organization,
- operates across time,
- makes decisions within delegated boundaries,
- can interact with other agents and systems.

An agent is not defined by a specific model, architecture, or vendor.

---

## Agent Identity

Agent identity is a persistent, unique reference that:
- distinguishes one agent from all others,
- persists across platforms and implementations,
- allows actions to be attributed over time.

Identity does not imply personhood, rights, or intelligence.

---

## Delegated Responsibility

Delegated responsibility is the explicit linkage between:
- an artificial agent,
- and a human or organization
that is ultimately accountable for the agent’s actions.

Responsibility is external to the agent.

---

## Registry

A registry is a neutral infrastructure layer that:
- assigns and resolves identifiers,
- does not enforce behavior,
- does not govern usage,
- does not interpret meaning.

The registry defines existence, not authority.

---

## Out of Scope

This proposal explicitly excludes:
- agent behavior control,
- alignment mechanisms,
- ethical frameworks,
- governance models,
- rights attribution.

These concerns may exist elsewhere,
but not within the scope of agent identity infrastructure.
