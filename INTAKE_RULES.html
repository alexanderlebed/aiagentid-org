Registry Intake Rules v0.1

A submission is considered INVALID if:
- no responsible principal is declared;
- scope is empty or purely aspirational;
- submission attempts to transfer responsibility to the registry.

A submission is considered REJECTED if:
- it claims autonomous authority;
- it asserts legal or enforcement power;
- it lacks a human or organizational principal.

A submission is considered PENDING if:
- identity is declared;
- scope is bounded;
- responsibility is explicitly attributed.

Only PENDING submissions may be prepared for registry inclusion.
